     ! Length of the buffer before writing to disk.

     ! Run time is bottlenecked by read/writes to file to a severe degree, so in general 
     ! this should be made as large as possible while still fitting in memory.

     ! Simulation memory with no buffer is
     ! approximately the size of a double (8 bytes) times 2 
     ! or 3 X,Y(,Z) times the number of particles. For example, with 1e6 particles, 
     ! approximate memory usage for channel simulation is 16e6 bytes, or 15.26MB.
